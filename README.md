# ReactDashboard

1) This project created in react js using html and css.
2) Created a navigation bar with search bar and some icons, left panel with the functionality of the Add button.
3) And created a floating form to add information and can be save.
4) The funtionality of save works but I faced some issues due to that the save file was supposed to be appear on
   dashboard but by some issues its appearing on the left panel I tried hard but as my time was up I counldn't fix it.
5) I have put Output Images in my Code please have look of them.
